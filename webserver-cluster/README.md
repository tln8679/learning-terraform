# webserver-cluster
- The following code creates a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances and creates a highly available and scalable load balancer.
- An aws auto scaling group is created so that a minimum of 2 instances are running at once. This scales up to a max of 10 instances based on traffic
- Health checks are enabled and instances that don't return status code 200 are taken down and replaced with a new instance.
